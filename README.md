# cpnt262-GroupProject
This was a group project I did with Matt Stewart, Ben Rizzoli, Ellie and Orlin Uzunov.
The goal of this project was to create a calculator and microwave UI using javascript.
For the calculator UI I did the following javascript functions; show, blank, keyLimit, handleKeyPress, calc, divZero, validBracket, calcStart, doublePeriod and doubleOp.
for the microwave UI I did the following javascript functions; clock, clr and addTime.
